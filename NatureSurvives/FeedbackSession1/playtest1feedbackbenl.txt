Display changes: Resource count should be prevalent /  up top (similar to AOE2)
Too little screen space, adjust UI size? Look into displaying food crystal and wood up top)

Concern: Icon's dont read well, monotonal (3d render?)Neon may be too intense - bleed effect hurts readability)

Resources blend into environment, could use icons/glow circles to represent interaction (interaction effects generally not clear!)

Farming not obvious - no farming animation!!!! (WHY) 

broodshroom may be floating..

Unit build not obvious (do we need unit delays - if so, need representation of progression)

Indication for resource depletion

Faded image when something is not buildable

Indication for how much of one thing is queued

button hover states

broodshroom: obvious to some players as a spawn point, but not others - Unattended broodshroom caused chaos! importance needs to be emphasized! 
(maybe an alert for when one spawns visual/audio) Maybe a spawn cap based on difficulty?? (They were building up rapidly) - Death animations not displaying (They exist!!)

Dying animation - some indication!! (dissolve)

Indication of day/night states (sun and moon icons) 

lighting: Shadows shouldnt be vertical (slight angle?) Ground shouldnt reflect light! (Moon should reflect a different ambience to daytime)

Display health bars (EVERYTHING) 

Towers were able to be placed directly into corruption zone (Corruption needs to spread/generate inaccessibility. condition for removing corruption, corruption should kill trees)

Geigerstrain should glow more on the map (turn up emission??)

Placing towers in corruption directly counters broodshroom

Debug - Why don't trees display self-shadows?
	WHY DO WONGLES PUNCH FARMS!?

All broodshrooms spawn simultaneously, no delay!! Corruption needs to spread to expand spawn zones

Level - tooflat? Variety: Chokepoints, bridges, chasms, verticality? 

Fog - You should only be able to see units in range of your own ( encouraging scouting)

Wonder: Needs to be more wonderous!! Placing a wonder should ramp up difficulty dramatically (more corruption?)

cubemap lighting?

Menu leads to testingblair: Visuals need dramatic improvement (nick failed)

Controls: No side swiping - Too sensitive when turning! pressing mouse to the side of the screen should move camera
          need more options to control panning - panning needs speed increase (interactive minimap?)
	  hotkey selection should be possible - w/box selection 
	  	
	  
Should have to select base before buildings appear in the GUI

Units should make a sound when they spawn (wongles)
Wongles should all be illuminated from below at night
Need to make different units more visually distinct - skin color/texture changes??

Minimap should be more zoomed out and allow for interactive selection sending

Players are super reliant on defensive towers

units are a little unresponsive when running away (spam clicking may be culprit, causing them to freeze)

Casting needs to be clearer - more anticipation for cobat casting 

Mining not always responsive, sometimes breaking (maybe strains are exhausted? if so they need to be removed!!) Movement towards interactives (farms, geiger) should be different)


ctrl turns off selection? double clicking unit should mass select the same type 

Worker count(?)

Key to cycle idle workers (?)

Select soldier states (patrolling/auto attack, guard etc) 

building cap. Rally point for spawn buildings - (potentially allow users to record command sequence for fresh spawn units)

Attacking should account for groups of enemies as opposed to single enemies - units need more clarity when they are taking hits - units should auto attack

Towers could do with a smaller hitbox to prevent walling - reliance on walls in future builds may require us to limit towers more in some way

Need an alternative fungus friend w/range attacks to counteract kiting strategies. 

trees should have a more cylandrical hitbox so units dont get stuck under them + more wood harvesting space for groups

...a group of fungus friends (20+) were unwilling to engage with two wongue units away from the base. Auto attack for enemies is an easy solution!
Fungus friends need to be stronger, they are super dumb/weak right now. Without a wonder they caused a stalemate. 

Fungus friends also aren't dying fast enough, causing lag when they fill the screen. 

camera seems to be tilting unpredictably until i thas become completely birds-eye for no reason. 

Map may need more crystals: They became super sparse and dragged out the game to an unnecessary extent

minimap icons aren't super clear due to neon monotone
