Concern: Icon's dont read well, monotonal (3d render?)


Unit build not obvious (do we need unit delays - if so, need representation of progression)                                           --- take time to spawn unit
Indication for how much of one thing is queued

broodshroom: obvious to some players as a spawn point, but not others - Unattended broodshroom caused chaos! importance needs to be emphasized! 
(maybe an alert for when one spawns visual/audio) Maybe a spawn cap based on difficulty?? (They were building up rapidly) - Death animations not displaying (They exist!!)
