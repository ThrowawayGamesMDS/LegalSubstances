1.  Camera Zoom is too jittery
2.  Pressing the middle mouse button causes the camera to spin and looks to dizzy
3.  The gnomes (workers) look evil, they look like the enemy
4.  Suggestion:  maybe the enemy should arrive 5 days after the start of the game, to give the player a chance to learn the game first.
5.  The UI should display the amount of wood, crystal and fool
6.  The Wonder, wongles, wizards, knights should have a description
7.  There either be a count of the number of wongles displayed, or have a notification that a wongle has died.
8.  Camera is shaking when being attacked, even when the player is not moving.
9.  The enemies are only spawned from 1 side.
10. Minimap issues, not being used because hard to use.  The icons aren't helpful, maybe a green dot would be more useful.
11. The ground is too flat.
12.  The wizard and knights are never used, didn't know what they did and didn't really need them.
13.  The artwork of the farm, are they hearts?  Doesn't really look pleaseant
14.  The hats are hard to see, so it was hard to tell what the wongles are.
15.  The 300 seconds on the Wonder is too long.
16.  How to Play, the text should be brighter, and the background should be more opaque
17.  Re-word how to play, with icons.
